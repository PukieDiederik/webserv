# FROM SUBJECT:
# 	In the configuration file, you should be able to:
# 	• Choose the port and host of each ’server’.
#	• Setup the server_names or not.
#	• The first server for a host:port will be the default for this host:port (that means it will answer to all the requests that don’t belong to an other server).
#	• Setup default error pages.
#	• Limit client body size.
#	• Setup routes with one or multiple of the following rules/configuration (routes wont be using regexp):
#		◦ Define a list of accepted HTTP methods for the route.
#		◦ Define a HTTP redirection.
#		◦ Define a directory or a file from where the file should be searched (for example, if url /kapouet is rooted to /tmp/www, url /kapouet/pouic/toto/pouet is /tmp/www/pouic/toto/pouet).
#		◦ Turn on or off directory listing.
#		◦ Set a default file to answer if the request is a directory.
#		◦ Execute CGI based on certain file extension (for example .php).
#		◦ Make it work with POST and GET methods.
#		◦ Make the route able to accept uploaded files and configure where they should be saved.

# Define how to handle CGI
